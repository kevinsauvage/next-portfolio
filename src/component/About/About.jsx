            Hello! My name is KÃ©vin. I'm a French developer living in Barcelona, SPAIN. I like to
            create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best
            practices. The main area of my expertise is front-end development using HTML, CSS, SASS,
            JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, but I also have some experience in back end development
            using Node.js, Express.js. When I'm not in front of the computer designing and
            developing interactive projects, I enjoy spending time in nature, listening music,
            travelling, working out, hiking, biking or swimming.
          </p>

      </div>
    </Section>
