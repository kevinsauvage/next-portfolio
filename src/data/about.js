    Hello, my name is KÃ©vin and I am a highly skilled and experienced freelance developer with a
    passion for staying current with the latest technologies and best practices. I specialize in
    front-end development and have extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, React/Next,
    and Svelte. My years of professional experience and constant self-study have honed my skills,
    making me proficient in creating visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly websites that
    meet the needs of any project.

    In addition to front-end development, I also have a keen interest in back-end development and
    have been working with Node.js and Express.js for some time. This has allowed me to gain a
    well-rounded understanding of the web development process and I have valuable experience in
    full-stack development.
    <br />
    <br />I am driven by a natural curiosity and willingness to learn, which has led me to
    continuously expand my skill set and knowledge base. This enables me to stay ahead of industry
    trends and adapt quickly to new technologies. I am confident in my ability to deliver
    high-quality, cutting-edge solutions that meet the needs of any project. My expertise in various
    technologies and ability to understand client's requirements makes me the perfect fit for your
    next project. Whether you need a new website, web application or any other digital solution, I
